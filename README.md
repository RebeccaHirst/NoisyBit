Create a continuous scale of luminance for images through randomly assigning an opacity setting to each pixel in an image. 
Python code runs in Psychopy version 1.85.2

Based on method outlined by Allard, R., & Faubert, J. (2008). The noisy-bit method for 
digital displays: Converting a 256 luminance resolution into a continuous resolution. Behavior Research Methods, 40(3), 735-743.
